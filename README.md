# FinnishRussianTradeBarrier
The project consists on analysing the discussions between (mainly) Russian users on a forum website about their business activities in Finland,regarding the fish industry and market. 
The goal is to investigate what are the main trade barriers encountered to develop their business exploiting NLP tools. 
Then, the focus is on the sentiment the users are experiencing while theyâ€™re approaching their difficulties. 
Moreover, we will compare them with official statistical data coming from the WEO (World Economic Organization), linking the macro-categories detected in the forum with the one classified by official trade organizations.
